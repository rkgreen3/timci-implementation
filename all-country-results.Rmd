# Background

The overall goal of this project is to reduce morbidity and mortality of sick children attending primary care facilities while supporting the rational and efficient use of diagnostics and medicines by healthcare providers. This study is focused on understanding the operational feasibility of multimodal pulse ox use in standard care. The results presented in this document describe several weeks of use of the Masimo pulse oximeter in primary care settings.

# Indicators of IMCI fidelity {.tabset}

1. Red classification of cough/difficulty breathing receives a referral and antibiotics.
2. Red classification of diarrhea receives treatment for dehydration.
3. Red classification of diarrhea AND red classification of anything else receives a referral.
